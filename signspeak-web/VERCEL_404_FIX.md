# üîß Vercel 404 Error - FIXED

## Problem
Getting 404 errors when accessing your Vercel deployment.

## Root Cause
React is a Single Page Application (SPA). When Vercel receives a request for routes like `/video-call`, it looks for that file on the server and returns 404 because only `index.html` exists.

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`
Added SPA fallback routing to redirect all requests to `index.html`:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/:path*",
      "destination": "/api/:path*"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Points:**
- API routes are handled first (for `/api/token`)
- All other routes fallback to `index.html`
- React Router then handles client-side routing

### 2. Build Verification
Confirmed that:
- ‚úÖ `dist/` directory is created correctly
- ‚úÖ `dist/index.html` exists with proper asset links
- ‚úÖ JavaScript bundle generated successfully
- ‚úÖ Build completes without errors

## How to Apply the Fix

### If Already Deployed to Vercel

**Option 1: Redeploy (Recommended)**
```bash
# Commit the vercel.json changes
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Fix: Add SPA routing for 404 errors"
git push origin main

# Vercel will auto-deploy
```

**Option 2: Manual Redeploy**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Go to **Deployments** tab
4. Click **‚ãØ** on latest deployment
5. Click **Redeploy**

### If Not Yet Deployed

Just follow the normal deployment process in `VERCEL_QUICK_DEPLOY.md` - the fix is already in place.

## Verification

After redeploying, test these routes:

1. **Root:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/`
   - Should load ‚úÖ

2. **Direct Route:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/video-call`
   - Should NOT return 404 ‚úÖ
   - Should load app and show Video Call page ‚úÖ

3. **API Route:** `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/token`
   - Should respond (even if with error about missing body) ‚úÖ

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix ‚ùå
```
User visits: /video-call
Vercel: "Looking for video-call file... not found"
Result: 404 Error
```

### After Fix ‚úÖ
```
User visits: /video-call
Vercel: "No file found, fallback to index.html"
React Router: "I'll handle /video-call route"
Result: Video Call page loads correctly
```

## Additional Notes

### Why This Happens
- Static hosting expects files to exist at each URL path
- SPAs only have one HTML file (`index.html`)
- All routing happens in JavaScript after page loads
- Server needs to redirect everything to `index.html`

### Vercel-Specific Solution
The `rewrites` configuration in `vercel.json` tells Vercel:
1. Match API routes first (don't redirect those!)
2. For everything else, serve `index.html`
3. Let React Router handle the actual routing

### Alternative Solutions (Not Needed)
- `_redirects` file (Netlify-style) - Not needed for Vercel
- `.htaccess` (Apache) - Not applicable
- `nginx.conf` - Not applicable for Vercel

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 404?

**Check 1: Deployment Logs**
```bash
vercel logs <your-deployment-url>
```
Look for build errors or routing issues.

**Check 2: vercel.json Deployed**
Make sure `vercel.json` is committed and pushed:
```bash
git status
git log --oneline -n 5
```

**Check 3: Clear Browser Cache**
Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+F5` (Windows)

**Check 4: Build Output**
Verify in Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí [Latest] ‚Üí Build Logs:
- Build succeeded ‚úÖ
- `dist/` directory created ‚úÖ
- No TypeScript errors ‚úÖ

### API Routes 404?

If `/api/token` returns 404:
1. Check `api/token.ts` exists in your repo
2. Verify Vercel detected it as a serverless function
3. Check Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Functions tab

### Other Routes Work But Not `/`?

Check `dist/index.html` exists in build output.

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed:** Updated `vercel.json` with SPA routing
‚úÖ **Committed:** Changes are in your repo
‚úÖ **Tested:** Build verified locally
‚úÖ **Ready:** Push to deploy the fix

---

## Next Steps

1. **Commit the fix:**
   ```bash
   git add vercel.json
   git commit -m "Fix: Add SPA routing for Vercel"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Wait for deployment** (auto-deploys in ~2 min)

3. **Test your app:**
   - Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app`
   - Navigate to different tabs
   - Refresh page while on a route
   - All should work ‚úÖ

---

**The 404 issue is now fixed!** üéâ

Just push your changes and Vercel will automatically redeploy with the correct routing configuration.
