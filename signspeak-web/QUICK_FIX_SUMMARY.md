# ðŸš¨ Vercel 404 Error - Fixed!

## What Was Wrong
Your React app (Single Page Application) was getting 404 errors because Vercel didn't know to redirect all routes to `index.html`.

## What I Fixed âœ…

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`
Added this critical routing rule:
```json
{
  "source": "/(.*)",
  "destination": "/index.html"
}
```

This tells Vercel: "For any route that doesn't match an API endpoint or static file, serve `index.html` and let React Router handle it."

## How to Deploy the Fix

```bash
# Commit the fix
git add vercel.json VERCEL_404_FIX.md
git commit -m "Fix: Add SPA routing for Vercel 404 errors"
git push origin main

# Vercel will automatically redeploy in ~2 minutes
```

## Verify It Works

After deployment:
1. Visit `https://your-app.vercel.app` âœ…
2. Navigate to Video Call tab âœ…
3. Refresh the page âœ…
4. URL should stay the same, no 404 âœ…

## Files Changed
- âœ… `vercel.json` - Added SPA routing
- âœ… `VERCEL_404_FIX.md` - Detailed explanation

## Why This Happened
React apps serve everything from one HTML file. When you visit `/video-call` directly, Vercel looked for a file called `video-call` and found nothing â†’ 404.

Now it redirects everything to `index.html` first, then React Router takes over.

**Status:** âœ… FIXED - Just push and redeploy!
